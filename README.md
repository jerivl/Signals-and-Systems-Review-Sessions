# Signals and Systems Review Sessions
UTD-IEEE review sessions for EE 3302

This repository consists of midterm review material for the undergraduate course "EE 3302 - Signals and Systems" at UT-Dallas. The course covers the basics of signal processing and LTI system theory intended for juniors in Electrical Engineering. Knowledge of integral calculus and possibly linear algebra be helpful. All examples are written in Python 3.8.2, but programming skills should not be needed to follow along.

## All of the Jupyter Notebooks included with this repo are intended to be used interactively during each scheduled review session.
This repository should be compatible with the latest version of Project Jupyter's Binder, an open source project that eases the task of sharing interactive code on-the-fly. More info here: https://mybinder.org/

#Review 1: TODO
Covers the basics of time-domain signal representation, convolution and system properties.

#Review 2: WIP
Covers the spectral characterization of signals though the Fourier Transform (FT) and Fourier Series (FS) as well as their properties. Gibb's phenomenon and the Dirchlet conditions for convergence are also touched on.

#Review 3: TODO
Covers the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, z-transform and introduces the idea of amplitude-modulation (DSB-AM). I may add a section on a few applications of the z-transform in the future.

My intention was to provide some exposition for the topics covered in each upcoming exam before working practice problems in an accompanying lecture. I hope that this material will be helpful for anyone in a similar course or at least scratches your curiosity.
